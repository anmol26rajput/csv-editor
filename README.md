### 👋 Why does this exist?
Let's face it: dealing with massive CSV files is a pain. Excel crashes, online tools sell your data, and writing Python scripts for every little change is exhausting. 

We built this tool because we wanted something **simple, fast, and beautiful** to handle the boring stuff so you can get back to work.
